Using Python3, DB : Postgresql

If want to test this : please run the ddl_tables.sql first (in same folder with this note) to create the schema and tables.

And then after that, can run script job.py in folder test, but please check your package python in file requirement.txt 

Task 1 : 
I load json from complex.json and tower.json to database with table in schema public. The name of tables are tower and complex.
the table is append (just insert), because i think, if it the real data, will be always insert to keep the logs (captures history of the data)
So, i add column insert_date (current_timestamp when insert). if want to get new data and update , just query condition in insert_date = max(insert_date) for each tables.

And for tables to queryable, in schema master with tables names :
- master.tower
- master.unit
- master.complex
In these tables, i used insert and update query.

In this task, i used status in file json for column IsActive, but i use logic if 0 then active when null then false. Because i don't see the status with value 1 for false or true.

Task 2 :
I used sql query to create this rank based on table complex with completenes images.

Task 3 :
I created new table to help user can easy query to this table and the table name in schema master with name analytic.property (master.analytic_property)


IF want to run file python and check manualy can see the pipelines : 
ddl_tables.sql (run just once) -> in folder test -> task1_load_complex.py -> task1_load_tower.py -> task1.py -> task3.py

or

If want to run all of jobs, after run ddl_tables.sql run job.py
job.py : script for run all task
